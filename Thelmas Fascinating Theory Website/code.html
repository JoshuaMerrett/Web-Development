			<h1><u>Quality Code</u></h1>	

			<h2><u>Readability</u></h2>
			<p>In regards to the term of quality code, readability refers to the code being clear and concise, as this is essential for the user to understand the code written. Code which is unorganised and generally presented in a messy format will result in the code becoming relatively unreadable and the code can become confused with the functions and properties of various parts of the project. This will result in the project becoming easier to add errors to the code due to the untidiness and disarray of the code.</p>

			<h2><u>Efficiency</u></h2>
			<p>This is a key aspect to ensure that the quality of code is acceptable, as maintaining a concise piece of code will result in it being easier to understand. Ensuring that the code within a project is efficient will make the process of programming simpler over time, as there are shorter methods available which developers will remember how to use. Along with this, with the code being efficient and concise it will be easier for developers to exchange code and fully understand what has been programmed, along with what parts function together. Also, with ensuring the code is efficient then the runtime of the project will be significantly reduced, as the system doesn’t need to read and interpret large sections of code. Along with this ensuring that the code is efficient will result in fewer errors occurring within the project, and if there are errors detected they will be easier to identify and resolve.</p>

			<h2><u>Commenting</u></h2>
			<p>Commenting on a project is an important process, as this ensures that the developer understands what a specific section of the code does, along with providing a reference for other developers to read. Commenting becomes useful in developing large projects as they act as markers so developers are easily able to find the specific sections of the code they are searching for. </p>

			<h1><u>Modularity</u></h1>	

			<h2><u>Classes</u></h2>
			<p>Classes are used as a template for creating multiple objects which possess the same states and behaviours. This is important as classes can also be used to improve the efficiency of the code, as this allows for the developer to have templates for each object within the program. Classes also help to improve the overall structure of the project. Classes can also be used to edit the objects on a mass scale, which in terms of efficiency saves time that would be used individually changing the states and behaviours of each object that needed to be edited.</p>

			<h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
			<p>Methods are another important feature used by developers, which is also used to improve the efficiency of the code. There can be multiple methods contained within projects which help to improve the efficiency as each method can be called anywhere within the code, resulting in the same code not needing to be programmed multiple times throughout the project.</p>

			<h1><u>Improve the Readability of code</u></h1>

			<p>There are a number of steps which developers can use to improve the readability of their code, this enables for the code to be easily read by the developer and other developers. The first step is to indent parts of the code, this can either be indenting the paragraph tags after a heading or indenting the headings and data of a table. This will ensure that the developer is able to easily read the sections, without needing to spend time identifying each tag. Another method of improving the readability of code, is that developers can add comments to highlight specific sections. This will enable the developer to understand what they have coded and make it easier for other developers to understand what has been coded and which sections are currently featured within the project.</p>
